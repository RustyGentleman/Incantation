# Incantation #
A fairly simple game developed as a project for Graph Theory class.  
  
Defend the cultists while they chant to invoke the mighty Lord of Lightning.  
Dark creatures will sense danger and come to try and cease it.  
Hold your ground until the Lord of Lightning comes to smite them all!  

### Mechanics ###
The game spans five minutes, each minute constituting a wave of enemies.  
Nine mages surround the Incantation Circle at the center, who must be defended.  
In each wave, a number of enemies of a certain type will be spawned at a given interval, which will move towards and attack the nearest mage.  
Between waves, the player will choose between two _'boons'_, which will grant stat bonuses to the player or heal the mages by a percentage.  
  
The game will end in failure if:  
1. the player connects two paths and forms a loop
2. all mages die

The game will end in victory if the player manages to keep at least one mage alive until the countdown ends, and the Lord of Lightning is summoned.
